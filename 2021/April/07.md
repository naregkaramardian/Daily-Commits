Made great progress in my NextJs learning journey created a sample app that lets you create an account that is integrated with AWS Cognito and add posts to your user account. Added functionality such that only Post owners can edit and delete the post and the rest just view the post the whole backend runs on AWS amplify, using AWS Appsync APIs Cognito and S3 to save the post image, below I’ve attached couple resources that helped my learning for today.
