Today I’ve been learning about NextJs, it's an awesome framework, that enhances React and gives it SSR Futures. It offers Routing out of the box, also typescript and SaSS out of the box, all you have to do is change the file extensions. Resources That I’ve enjoyed learning from:

* [Next.js Docs](https://nextjs.org/docs)
* [Next.js - The ultimate way to build React apps (educative)](https://www.educative.io/courses/next-js-build-react-apps)
* [Next.js in 100 Seconds // Plus Full Beginner's Tutorial (Fireship)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sklc_fQBmcs)
* [Next.js Crash Course 2021 (Traversy Media)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTz0GXj8NN0)

## Have Fun Learning!
